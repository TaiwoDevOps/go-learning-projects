## Go CLI application that can create bookings for an event

### 1a: Inform user if no tickets left and exits

### 1 : Allow user input their bio data {first and last name, age, email}

### 2: Allow user book number of tickets from the event {ticket count}

### 3: Return information about just booked ticket by user {bio data and ticket count}

### 4: Inform admin (console) of how many tickets left after each booking

### 5: Inform user if ticket is less than user ticket request

### Give multiple location for users, and present data requirements based on location

### validate user inputs (lengths of names), (email as @), ticket is greater than zero and less and available ticket number.

### Only print first names and locations of all guests from bookings array to admin

### Best practices: encapsulate (using functions since Go doesn't use classes)
